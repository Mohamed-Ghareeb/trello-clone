<h1>Introduction</h1>
This project is a web-based Trello clone that allows users to create and manage boards, columns, and cards.
It mimics the functionality of Trello, a popular project management tool, by providing an intuitive interface for organizing tasks and projects.
The project is built using Laravel, Livewire, and several other modern tools and libraries to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.


<h1>Features</h1>

<h3 align="left">Board Management:</h3>
<p>Create and manage multiple boards to organize your tasks and projects. Each board can represent a different project or category, making it easy to separate and focus on various areas of work.</p>

<h3 align="left">Column Management:</h3>

<h3 align="left">Card Management:</h3>
<p>Create cards within columns to represent individual tasks or items. Cards can be moved between columns via drag-and-drop, allowing you to track progress seamlessly. Each card can have its own title, description, and be assigned to specific users.</p>

<h3 align="left">Drag-and-Drop Sorting:</h3>
<p>Rearrange boards, columns, and cards with a simple drag-and-drop interface. The project uses Livewire Sortable JS and Spatie/Eloquent-Sortable to enable this smooth and intuitive experience.</p>
